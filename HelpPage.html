                Schedule Data Transfer (SDT) is a web app that allows you to automatically download a 
                Google Sheet from Google Drive to a local server in Seagate (server has to support SFTP/FTPS) 
                according to your specified schedule. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Any Seagator with Seagate’s Gmail and Google Drive account can use this app. For first time users, 
                this app will need the approval of the user to access his/her Google Drive files for it to download. 
            </p>
    
            <h5>HOW DO I ACCESS THE APPLICATION? </h5>
    
            <p>
                You can access the app via the ‘freckles’ menu (the 3x3 boxes) from your Seagate Gmail/Drive/Calendar 
                (You’ll have to scroll/click on the ‘More’ link if you can’t find it). Look for the Scheduled Data Transfer icon. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Note: <br>
    
                First time users to the app will be forwarded to a Google Approval page, where you’ll be requested to 
                provide the app access to your Google Drive file for it to pick and download to your target location. 
                Click on the Accept button to proceed.
